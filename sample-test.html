// --- DATA: 100 QUESTIONS ---
const questions = [
    { category: "Approaches", question: "Who is considered the first scholar to conduct a systematic comparative study of governments by analyzing 158 constitutions of Greek city-states and other polities?", options: ["Plato", "Aristotle", "Cicero", "Polybius"], correct: 1, explanation: "Aristotle is widely regarded as the earliest proponent of the institutional approach in comparative politics. In his work, he undertook an extensive empirical study, comparing the constitutions and political practices of a total of 158 different political systems." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "According to Jean Blondel, who are considered the 'True founders of the Comparative Government Approach' for their influential works in the late 19th and early 20th centuries?", options: ["Aristotle and Plato", "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels", "Bryce and Lowell", "Herman Finer and Carl Friedrich"], correct: 2, explanation: "Jean Blondel specifically credits James Bryce and A. Lawrence Lowell as the 'True founders' of this modern iteration of the institutional approach. Their works shifted the focus towards a more systematic study of the formal governmental institutions of major Western powers." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "Which of the following is NOT a common criticism leveled against the traditional Institutional Approach?", options: ["It is Ethnocentric, focusing primarily on European democracies.", "It is overly empirical and data-driven, neglecting normative questions.", "It is Prescriptive and Normative in nature.", "It is Historical without being sufficiently analytical."], correct: 1, explanation: "The traditional Institutional Approach is criticized for being ethnocentric, normative, and descriptive rather than analytical. The criticism that it is 'overly empirical and data-driven' is incorrect; in fact, the behavioral revolution emerged to make the study more empirical." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "The revival of institutionalism in the 1980s, known as Neo-institutionalism, is most closely associated with which pair of scholars?", options: ["David Easton and Gabriel Almond", "Seymour Martin Lipset and Samuel P. Huntington", "James G. March and Johann P. Olsen", "Robert Dahl and Charles Lindblom"], correct: 2, explanation: "Neo-institutionalism's intellectual architects are James G. March and Johann P. Olsen. Their groundbreaking works in the 1980s laid the theoretical groundwork for this new approach, arguing that political outcomes are profoundly shaped by the institutional context." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "What is the primary analytical shift from the old Institutionalism to Neo-institutionalism?", options: ["A shift from studying non-Western countries to studying only Western democracies.", "A shift from a focus on informal norms to a strict focus on formal legal rules.", "A shift from describing formal structures to analyzing how institutions, both formal and informal, shape individual behavior and political outcomes.", "A shift from quantitative analysis to purely historical narratives."], correct: 2, explanation: "The core intellectual leap from the old to the new institutionalism is its analytical focus. It moved from describing formal structures to explaining how institutions—both formal and informal—constrain and enable the behavior of political actors." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "The assumption that individuals are rational actors who make decisions based on cost-benefit analyses within the constraints of institutional rules is central to which approach?", options: ["Sociological Institutionalism", "Historical Institutionalism", "Discursive Institutionalism", "Rational Choice Institutionalism"], correct: 3, explanation: "Rational Choice Institutionalism is built upon the assumption that political actors are rational and self-interested utility-maximizers who calculate costs and benefits within an institutional framework of rules and procedures." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "The concept that historical processes and critical junctures create institutions that persist over time and constrain future choices, often referred to as the 'Logic of Path-dependency', is the cornerstone of which approach?", options: ["Rational Choice Institutionalism", "Historical Institutionalism", "Sociological Institutionalism", "Discursive Institutionalism"], correct: 1, explanation: "Historical Institutionalism emphasizes the role of time and historical sequence. Its central concept is 'path dependency,' which suggests that early decisions can lock in a particular institutional arrangement for a long time, making it difficult to deviate from the established path." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "The idea that political institutions are shaped by cultural norms and that actors follow a 'Logic of Appropriateness' based on what is socially and culturally expected is central to:", options: ["Rational Choice Institutionalism", "Historical Institutionalism", "Sociological Institutionalism", "Discursive Institutionalism"], correct: 2, explanation: "Sociological Institutionalism argues that institutions are embedded in a society's culture. Actors are guided by a 'Logic of Appropriateness,' where they behave based on shared understandings, identities, and what is considered legitimate action." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "Which approach to comparative politics is defined by its focus on understanding social and political phenomena by viewing economics and politics as interconnected forces?", options: ["Systems Approach", "Structural-Functionalism", "Political Economy Approach", "Political Culture Approach"], correct: 2, explanation: "The Political Economy Approach fundamentally rejects the notion that politics and economics can be studied in isolation. Its core premise is that economic forces and political power are mutually constitutive." },
    { category: "Development Theories", question: "Who is considered the 'father of Modern Political Economy' for his 1776 book 'Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'?", options: ["David Ricardo", "Karl Marx", "John Maynard Keynes", "Adam Smith"], correct: 3, explanation: "Adam Smith is universally regarded as the father of modern political economy. His magnum opus, 'The Wealth of Nations' (1776), laid the intellectual foundation for classical economics and capitalism." },
    { category: "Development Theories", question: "Arrange W.W. Rostow's five stages of economic growth in the correct chronological order: 1. Traditional stage, 2. Take-off, 3. Precondition for take-off, 4. High Mass Consumption, 5. Drive to Maturity", options: ["1, 2, 3, 5, 4", "1, 3, 2, 5, 4", "3, 1, 2, 4, 5", "1, 3, 5, 2, 4"], correct: 1, explanation: "The correct sequence of Rostow's stages is: 1. Traditional stage -> 3. Precondition for take-off -> 2. Take-off -> 5. Drive to Maturity -> 4. High Mass Consumption." },
    { category: "Development Theories", question: "Which school of thought emerged as a major critique of Modernization Theory, arguing that underdevelopment in the 'Periphery' is a direct consequence of its economic relationship with the developed 'Core' nations?", options: ["Post-Modernism", "Dependency Theory", "Behavioralism", "Neo-institutionalism"], correct: 1, explanation: "Dependency Theory fundamentally challenged Modernization Theory by arguing that underdevelopment was an active process, famously termed the 'development of underdevelopment,' caused by the exploitative global capitalist system." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "According to Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba's classic 1963 study, *The Civic Culture*, what is political culture?", options: ["The formal constitutional arrangements of a political system.", "The set of economic policies pursued by the government.", "'Political Orientations and Attitudes towards the Political System.'", "The process of elite recruitment and circulation."], correct: 2, explanation: "In 'The Civic Culture', Almond and Verba defined political culture as the specific pattern of 'political orientations and attitudes towards the political system' held by the members of a society." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "In *The Civic Culture*, which type of political culture is characterized by citizens being aware of political outputs but having a passive, obedient relationship to the system?", options: ["Parochial Culture", "Subject Culture", "Participant Culture", "Homogenous Culture"], correct: 1, explanation: "In a Subject Culture, citizens are aware of the national political system and its outputs, but their relationship to it is passive. They see themselves as 'subjects' of the government rather than active participants." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "Almond and Powell identified three types of political orientation. Which refers to the feelings of attachment, involvement, or rejection towards political objects?", options: ["Cognitive Orientation", "Affective Orientation", "Evaluative Orientation", "Participative Orientation"], correct: 1, explanation: "Affective Orientation is the emotional dimension of political culture. It encompasses feelings of attachment, loyalty, pride, cynicism, or rejection that a citizen has towards political objects." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "David Easton's Systems Approach in political science was significantly inspired by which broader scientific theory?", options: ["Einstein's Theory of Relativity", "Darwin's Theory of Evolution", "Ludwig von Bertalanffy's General Systems Theory", "Pavlov's Classical Conditioning"], correct: 2, explanation: "Easton drew his primary inspiration from General Systems Theory (GST), developed by biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, which proposed that complex phenomena could be understood by analyzing them as 'systems'." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "In David Easton's political system model, the 'Inputs' that flow from the environment into the political system consist of which two main components?", options: ["Laws and Policies", "Demands and Support", "Legislature and Executive", "Power and Authority"], correct: 1, explanation: "In Easton's model, the interaction between the system and its environment happens through two fundamental types of 'inputs': Demands (needs and wants) and Support (attitudes and behaviors that sustain the system)." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "In David Easton's model, what is the function of the 'Political System' itself, often described as a 'black box'?", options: ["To generate demands from the environment.", "To directly implement policies without modification.", "To filter and convert the inputs of demands and support into outputs.", "To create a feedback loop that connects outputs to the environment."], correct: 2, explanation: "The 'Political System' in Easton's framework acts as a central processing unit or 'gatekeeper'. Its primary role is to filter and convert inputs (demands and support) into 'outputs' (binding decisions and actions)." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "What is the most significant difference between David Easton's Systems Approach and Gabriel Almond's Structural-Functional Model?", options: ["Easton's model is cyclical, while Almond's is linear.", "Almond's model includes inputs and outputs, while Easton's does not.", "Easton's model includes a 'feedback loop', while Almond's model does not have this feature.", "Almond's model applies only to democratic systems, while Easton's is universal."], correct: 2, explanation: "The most crucial distinction is the 'feedback loop'. In Easton's model, this loop connects outputs back to the environment, influencing the next round of inputs, making the model dynamic. Almond's original model lacks this explicit feedback mechanism." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "According to Gabriel Almond's Structural-Functionalism, which of the following are all considered 'Input Functions'?", options: ["Rule Making, Rule Application, Rule Adjudication", "Political Socialisation, Interest Articulation, Interest Aggregation, Political Communication", "Demand, Support, Feedback, Environment", "Legitimacy, Penetration, Participation, Distribution"], correct: 1, explanation: "The four input functions in Almond's model are: Political Socialisation and Recruitment, Interest Articulation, Interest Aggregation, and Political Communication. These are the processes through which society makes its demands known." },
    { category: "Approaches", question: "In Almond's Structural-Functional model, the functions of Rule Making, Rule Application, and Rule Adjudication are known as what?", options: ["Input Functions", "Feedback Functions", "Environmental Functions", "Output Functions"], correct: 3, explanation: "The output functions are the authoritative actions performed by the governmental structures. They are: Rule Making (legislative), Rule Application (executive), and Rule Adjudication (judicial)." },
    { category: "State Theory", question: "The classic definition of the state in the 1933 Montevideo Convention requires which four features?", options: ["A defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government, and a standing army.", "A defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.", "A permanent population, a national currency, an effective government, and a written constitution.", "A defined territory, a common language, a single-party system, and a sovereign leader."], correct: 1, explanation: "The Montevideo Convention codifies four essential criteria for statehood: 1) a defined territory, 2) a permanent population, 3) an effective government, and 4) the capacity to enter into relations with other states." },
    { category: "State Theory", question: "Which scholar famously argued that 'War made the state, and the state made war'?", options: ["Max Weber", "Karl Marx", "Michael Mann", "Charles Tilly"], correct: 3, explanation: "Charles Tilly argued that the modern state was an unintended byproduct of centuries of warfare. Rulers had to develop the core capacities of the state (taxation, administration) to be successful in war." },
    { category: "State Theory", question: "In the *Communist Manifesto*, the Marxist view of the state under capitalism is summarized by which statement?", options: ["The state is a night-watchman.", "The state is a neutral umpire.", "The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.", "War made the state, and the state made war."], correct: 2, explanation: "The classical Marxist theory of the state is instrumentalist. The famous quote from the *Communist Manifesto* perfectly encapsulates this view, suggesting the state's institutions are designed to serve the capitalist class." },
    { category: "State Theory", question: "The concept of a 'night-watchman state', a minimalist state limited to protecting individuals from force, theft, and fraud, is most famously advocated by which liberal thinker?", options: ["John Maynard Keynes", "John Rawls", "Robert Nozick", "T.H. Green"], correct: 2, explanation: "The 'night-watchman state' is the cornerstone of libertarian political philosophy, most forcefully argued by Robert Nozick in his book 'Anarchy, State, and Utopia' (1974)." },
    { category: "State Theory", question: "What is the key distinction between the instrumentalist view of Ralph Miliband and the structuralist view of Nicos Poulantzas on the state?", options: ["Miliband believed the state serves the working class, while Poulantzas believed it serves the capitalists.", "Miliband focused on the social ties between state officials and capitalists, while Poulantzas argued the state's structure inherently reproduces capitalism.", "Miliband was a proponent of the welfare state, while Poulantzas advocated for a minimalist state.", "Miliband's theory applies to socialist states, while Poulantzas's applies to capitalist states."], correct: 1, explanation: "The Miliband-Poulantzas debate highlights two views: Miliband's instrumentalism (the state is an instrument because of who runs it) and Poulantzas's structuralism (the state serves capitalism because of its structural position, regardless of who runs it)." },
    { category: "State Theory", question: "The theory of the 'overdeveloped state' in post-colonial societies was proposed by:", options: ["Partha Chatterjee", "Frantz Fanon", "Hamza Alavi", "Edward Said"], correct: 2, explanation: "Hamza Alavi developed the theory of the 'overdeveloped state' to explain how post-colonial states inherited a powerful bureaucratic-military apparatus from the colonial era that was disproportionately strong compared to domestic social classes." },
    { category: "Political Regimes", question: "Richard Titmuss classified welfare states into three models. Which model, exemplified by Scandinavian countries, is based on universal services provided as an integral part of society?", options: ["Residual (Liberal) Model", "Industrial Achievement (Corporatist) Model", "Institutional Redistributive (Social Democratic) Model", "Minimalist (Libertarian) Model"], correct: 2, explanation: "The Institutional Redistributive (Social Democratic) Model, associated with Scandinavia, views social welfare as a fundamental right of citizenship and provides universal, high-quality services to all citizens." },

    { category: "Representation & Governance", question: "Which event is considered a key trigger for the 'First Reverse Wave' of democratization (1922-1942)?", options: ["The Russian Revolution of 1917", "The end of World War I", "The rise of Fascism with Mussolini's March on Rome in 1922", "The Great Depression of 1929"], correct: 2, explanation: "The First Reverse Wave, according to Huntington, was initiated by the rise of authoritarian and fascist ideologies, exemplified by Benito Mussolini's ascent to power in Italy in 1922, which provided an alternative model to democracy." },
    { category: "Political Regimes", question: "Who wrote the influential book *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (1974), which provides a philosophical justification for the minimalist 'night-watchman state'?", options: ["John Rawls", "Isaiah Berlin", "F.A. Hayek", "Robert Nozick"], correct: 3, explanation: "Robert Nozick's *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* is the foundational text for modern libertarianism, arguing that any state more extensive than a minimal one that protects property rights and enforces contracts is morally unjustifiable." },
    { category: "Democratization & Colonialism", question: "The concept of 'mimicry' in post-colonial theory, describing the ambivalent way in which the colonized imitate the colonizer's language and culture, is most associated with which thinker?", options: ["Edward Said", "Homi K. Bhabha", "Gayatri Spivak", "Frantz Fanon"], correct: 1, explanation: "Homi K. Bhabha developed the concept of 'mimicry' to describe the often-parodic imitation of the colonizer by the colonized. He argued this creates an ambivalent 'third space' that challenges the authority of colonial discourse." },
    { category: "Representation & Governance", question: "What is Duverger's Law?", options: ["A law stating that multi-party systems are more stable than two-party systems.", "A sociological principle that all organizations tend towards oligarchy.", "A principle which states that first-past-the-post electoral systems tend to produce two-party systems.", "A law that defines the legal requirements for forming a political party in France."], correct: 2, explanation: "Duverger's Law is a well-known principle in political science which posits a strong correlation between the use of a first-past-the-post (or plurality) electoral system and the emergence of a two-party political system." },
    { category: "Thinkers & Concepts", question: "Which scholar, associated with the Subaltern Studies group, famously asked 'Can the Subaltern Speak?' to highlight the problem of epistemic violence and the silencing of marginalized voices?", options: ["Partha Chatterjee", "Ranajit Guha", "Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak", "Homi K. Bhabha"], correct: 2, explanation: "Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's influential essay 'Can the Subaltern Speak?' questions whether marginalized groups (the subaltern) can ever truly represent themselves in dominant Western discourses without being co-opted or misinterpreted." },
    { category: "Representation & Governance", question: "The concept of a 'dominant party system,' where one party governs continuously in a context of free elections (e.g., Congress in India before 1977), was elaborated by which scholar?", options: ["Giovanni Sartori", "Maurice Duverger", "Jean Blondel", "Arend Lijphart"], correct: 0, explanation: "While Duverger identified the category, Giovanni Sartori extensively analyzed and defined the 'dominant party system' as a distinct type, separate from a true one-party state, because electoral competition, however lopsided, still exists." },
    { category: "Political Regimes", question: "Hannah Arendt, in *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, distinguishes totalitarianism from simple dictatorships by its unique combination of which two elements?", options: ["Ideology and Terror", "Nationalism and Militarism", "Propaganda and Charisma", "Bureaucracy and Law"], correct: 0, explanation: "For Hannah Arendt, totalitarianism is a novel form of rule that cannot be equated with traditional tyranny. Its defining characteristic is the combination of an all-encompassing ideology that claims to explain all of history and a system of pervasive, arbitrary terror that atomizes the population and destroys the space for human action and spontaneity." },
    { category: "Development Theories", question: "In Fred W. Riggs's ecological model, a society caught between traditional and modern norms, characterized by a high degree of 'formalism' (where rules on paper don't match reality), is called a:", options: ["Fused Society", "Diffracted Society", "Prismatic Society", "Agrarian Society"], correct: 2, explanation: "Fred Riggs used the metaphor of a prism splitting light to describe transitional societies. A 'Fused' society is traditional, where structures are multi-functional. A 'Diffracted' society is modern, with specialized structures. The 'Prismatic Society' is the transitional stage, where old and new norms coexist, leading to formalism, overlapping functions, and corruption. The 'Sala model' is his term for the administrative subsystem in a prismatic society." },
    { category: "Political Regimes", question: "Arend Lijphart's theory of 'Consociational Democracy' is designed to provide stable democratic governance in which type of society?", options: ["Homogenous societies with a strong national identity", "Societies with high levels of economic inequality", "Deeply divided or plural societies with distinct ethnic or religious segments", "Post-industrial societies focused on new social movements"], correct: 2, explanation: "Consociationalism, developed by Arend Lijphart, is a model of democracy specifically designed for deeply divided (plural) societies, where political stability is threatened by sharp ethnic, religious, or linguistic cleavages. It relies on power-sharing mechanisms among the elites of the different segments, such as grand coalitions, mutual vetoes, proportionality in appointments, and segmental autonomy." },
    { category: "Political Regimes", question: "According to Robert Dahl, a political system with high levels of both public contestation and the right to participate, which is the closest real-world approximation of the democratic ideal, is known as a:", options: ["Liberal Democracy", "Social Democracy", "Polyarchy", "Competitive Oligarchy"], correct: 2, explanation: "In his work *Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition*, Robert Dahl argues that the pure ideal of democracy is unattainable. He uses the term 'Polyarchy' to describe real-world regimes that have two key dimensions: high levels of public contestation (opposition is permitted) and high levels of inclusiveness (the right to participate is widespread). For Dahl, a polyarchy is not a perfect democracy, but it is the form of government that is the closest practical approximation of the democratic ideal." },
    { category: "Representation & Governance", question: "The principle of 'Separation of Powers,' famously elaborated by Montesquieu and embedded in the US Constitution, divides governmental authority among which three branches?", options: ["The President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives", "The Federal Government, the State Governments, and the Local Governments", "The Legislative, the Executive, and the Judicial branches", "The Military, the Bureaucracy, and the Presidency"], correct: 2, explanation: "The US Constitution is built on the principle of Separation of Powers to prevent the concentration of power in any single entity. It divides the core functions of government into three distinct branches: the Legislative branch (Congress), responsible for making laws; the Executive branch (the Presidency), responsible for enforcing laws; and the Judicial branch (the Supreme Court and lower courts), responsible for interpreting laws. This is combined with a system of checks and balances, where each branch has some power over the others." }
